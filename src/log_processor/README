This piece of code can be used using a fairly recent Perl (e.g. 5.20)
and a certain set of CPAN modules. Any modern (as of 2017) OS includes
a perfectly good Perl which can be used. To install the modules, just
install carton to the system (sudo apt-get install carton in Debian,
pkg install p5-carton in FreeBSD) and then issue 'carton' inside the
directory. Other than carton itself, nothing more will be installed
system-wide, so the base OS will not be littered with packages and
modules. All the necessary modules will be installed locally under
local/ in this dir and their versions will not clash with other
installed and used versions of the same modules elsewhere. The local/
directory can also be tranferred as-is in case of a need to quickly
transfer the software in another location or host.
